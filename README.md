   An android app for displaying a graph of a function f(ct+d) with Y axis as the f(ct+d) & X-axis as 't'.
    
   
   Given:
   
          f(ct+d)= (a-x)/a     when t<0
                 =  1          when 0=<t<=b
                 =  0          else
                 
                 
a,b,c & d are variables and can be changed & with respect to the change, the graph will change accordingly.
